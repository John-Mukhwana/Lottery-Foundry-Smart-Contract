# Learning Log

## Key Concepts and Commands Learned

### Solidity
- NatSpec comments: Used for documentation (`@title`, `@author`, `@notice`)
- Constructor: Initializes contract state at deployment
- block.timestamp: Current block's timestamp for time-based logic

### Raffle Contract
- Structure: Errors, State Variables, Events, Constructor, Functions
+- Example Structure:

```
// Layout of the contract file:
// version
// imports
// errors
// interfaces, libraries, contract

// Inside Contract:
// Type declarations
// State variables
// Events
// Modifiers
// Functions

// Layout of Functions:
// constructor
// receive function (if exists)
// fallback function (if exists)
// external
// public
// internal
// private
// view & pure functions
```

### Foundry Commands
- forge build
- forge test
- forge fmt
- forge snapshot
- anvil
- forge script ...
- cast <subcommand>
- git remote add/set-url origin ...
- git add . && git commit -m "..."
- git push origin master

### Git Troubleshooting
- Error: remote origin already exists → use `git remote set-url origin <url>`
- Error: src refspec master does not match any → make a commit first

## Chronological Log

1. Initialized repository and set remote.
2. Learned about submodules and embedded repos.
3. Fixed git errors and pushed initial commit.
4. Explored contract structure and NatSpec comments.
5. Learned about constructors and block.timestamp.
6. Implemented basic Raffle contract.
7. Documented common Foundry and git commands.



## Questions

### 1. What fundamental limitation prevents smart contracts from executing actions based purely on the passage of time or external conditions?
**Correct Answer:**
They cannot initiate transactions themselves; they require an external trigger.
**Explanation:**
Smart contracts are passive and only execute when triggered by an external transaction. They cannot run automatically based on time or external events without someone (or something, like Chainlink Automation) sending a transaction.

### 2. In the context of Chainlink Automation, how are time-based triggers defined?
**Correct Answer:**
Using Cron expressions to specify a recurring schedule.
**Explanation:**
Chainlink Automation uses cron expressions to allow developers to set up recurring, time-based triggers for contract functions, similar to scheduling jobs in traditional systems.

### 3. When registering an upkeep for an unverified smart contract with Chainlink Automation, what information is required besides the contract address?
**Correct Answer:**
The contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface).
**Explanation:**
The ABI is needed so Chainlink Automation knows how to interact with the contract's functions, even if the source code is not verified.

### 4. Compared to using simple revert statements or custom errors without parameters, what key capability do parameterized custom errors add?
**Correct Answer:**
The ability to return dynamic data reflecting the contract's state when the error occurred.
**Explanation:**
Parameterized custom errors can include relevant state information, making debugging and error handling more informative and efficient.

### 5. Which Solidity code snippet correctly defines a custom error named `InvalidInput` that accepts a `uint256` parameter?
**Correct Answer:**
error InvalidInput(uint256 providedValue);
**Explanation:**
This is the correct syntax for defining a custom error in Solidity with a parameter.

### 6. Within the Foundry testing framework, what is the standard function used to set up the initial state, deploy contracts, and prepare variables before each test case runs?
**Correct Answer:**
setUp()
**Explanation:**
The `setUp()` function is automatically called before each test in Foundry, allowing you to initialize state and deploy contracts for testing.

### 7. In Solidity, if a contract `MyContract` defines an enum `MyState { STATE_A, STATE_B }`, how would you typically access the value corresponding to `STATE_A` from outside the contract or within a test?
**Correct Answer:**
MyContract.MyState.STATE_A
**Explanation:**
You access enum values using the contract name, the enum name, and the value, e.g., `MyContract.MyState.STATE_A`.
